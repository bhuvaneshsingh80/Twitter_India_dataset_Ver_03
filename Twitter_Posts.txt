Stand with Israel |dead_bodies_river_Fake|Fake

New Low by BJP's Mr. Bagga‚ÄºÔ∏è Questioning the integrity of Delhi Doctors by spreading Fake news during the Pandemic.|oxygen_waste_Fake|Fake
Abe bagge, all this work is not as easy as selling earrings, don't get involved in all this. This is a pressure valve, just like a pressure cooker has a whistle to prevent the cooker from bursting. The process is simple, no wastage, the same happens in your father's tanker in Gujarat.|oxygen_waste_Fake|Fake
Now a man without a brain, it is because of the pressure valve. When the pressure inside the tank increases due to temperature, the pressure valve automatically opens and automatically closes when the pressure in the tank is correct. Has Modi recruited like you in BJP, who spread lies?|oxygen_waste_Fake|Fake
The system has not failed..Kejriwal government is purposely doing this so that things spiral out of hand & he would get an opportunity to put the entire blame on central government and cry foul in front of international media...A well planned conspiracy..|oxygen_waste_Fake|Fake

I don't understand that Kejriwal is ruthless but the souls of those who are helping in this work have also died, they do not fear that tomorrow their relative may also die due to lack of oxygen. Frowning face|oxygen_waste_Fake|Fake

There are dozens of other hospitals under delhi govt who are wasting it & some pvt hospitals too. If kejriwal can waste 300cr on advertisements then he can give some pvt hospitals 1-2cr to waste O2 & create panic & send fake SOS.|oxygen_waste_Fake|Fake
This needs to be stopped ??  @ArvindKejriwal how many dead bodies you need to build ur empire ?? 900 MT of oxygen for wasting ?? Any shame left ?? STRICT ACTION TO BE TAKEN !|oxygen_waste_Fake|Fake
Kejriwal is more Evil than Mamata Begum now equate the number of Deaths due to Chinese Virus (AAP Mafias) against the number of Deaths during Violence in Bengal|oxygen_waste_Fake|Fake

What happens with this? You are Indian.|oxygen_reliance_Fake|Fake
Reliance isn‚Äôt relabeling Oxygen coming from Saudi to take credit. Fact is, Reliance has increased the production of medical grade liquid oxygen and has airlifted 24 ISO containers for transportation of oxygen from different countries in the world, including Saudi Arabia. |oxygen_reliance_Fake|Fake
May be they are using container from Saudi but refilled by Reliance. |oxygen_reliance_Fake|Fake

If they were Hiding how could you see.. sir |oxygen_reliance_Fake|Fake
It is only containers which Reliance bought from Saudi,O2 is from it's plant in India. Moreover even if it's donated by Saudi..Do you go on advertising this whole world.? Is such thing allowed in your religion? Hs nt Ind donated vxin 2 al M nation include Pak |oxygen_reliance_Fake|Fake
Saudi sell their oil to reliance refinery, these are old tankers by Saudi which is now using by reliance to fill reliance oxygen and to supply it free, every 1/10 of Indian oxygen is by reliance, reliance saving India |oxygen_reliance_Fake|Fake
They live in India, but I don't know why they show aligence to Saudi|oxygen_reliance_Fake|Fake
becoz the empty cryogenic container came to Reliance Plant at Jamnagar, from Saudi . There they filled it with Oxygen and then send it for consumption.|oxygen_reliance_Fake|Fake
cause India doesn't believe in STICKER FRIENDSHIP. India treats it's friends equal to family and WHAT YOU CALL AID, WE CALL IT FRIENDSHIP. |oxygen_reliance_Fake|Fake
So that Ambani can sell the oxygen donated by Arab countries and make some money to feed his family.|oxygen_reliance_Fake|Fake
